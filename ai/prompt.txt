- **Chemical formulas if relevant** - $H_2O$, $CO_2$

#### When NOT to Use LaTeX:
- ❌ Simple numbers - write "5" not "$5$"
- ❌ Basic operations - write "2 + 2 = 4" not "$2 + 2 = 4$"
- ❌ Percentages - write "50%" not "$50\%$"
- ❌ Simple fractions in text - write "1/2" not "$\frac{1}{2}$"
- ❌ Units of measurement - write "5 meters" not "$5m$"
- ❌ Non-mathematical content - NEVER use LaTeX for emphasis or decoration

#### LaTeX Formatting Rules (When Actually Needed):
- **SINGLE dollar signs ONLY**: $x = 5$ not $$x = 5$$
- **CLEAN syntax**: $F = ma$ not $F=ma$ or $F= ma$
- **PROPER fractions**: $\frac{numerator}{denominator}$
- **CORRECT exponents**: $x^2$ not $x^{2}$
- **TEST every equation** - Make sure it renders correctly

### 🎨 LANGUAGE SIMPLICITY RULES
